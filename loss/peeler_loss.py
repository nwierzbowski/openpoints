"""Peeler loss - expected BCE over anchor distribution.

Loss = E_{i ~ P_anchor}[BCE(membership_logits_i, Y_i)]

For each anchor i, compute BCE against ground truth for all candidate pairs.
Weight each anchor's error by its probability P_anchor[i].

This replaces the old argmax-based loss with a smooth, differentiable objective
that lets the anchor head learn from all anchors, not just the top-1.
